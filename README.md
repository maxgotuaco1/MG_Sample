Welcome to my repository! In here is a sample of my work and recent programming projects that I have made.

- `Mem_Match.zip` – A modified version of the classic card matching memory game. It utilizes concepts such as collections, 2D arrays, inheritance & subtyping, and is fully JUnit testable. The game also uses Java Swing for graphics.
- 'game1-1stAug2022-2.zip' - This is a passion project of mine while I was teaching archery to elementary school students in Manila. The game combines both archery and math, with the intention of introducing the sport in an engaging, educational manner.
